https://leetcode.com/problems/recyclable-and-low-fat-products?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50


# Intuition
To find products that are both low fat and recyclable, we need to filter records where `low_fats = 'Y'` and `recyclable = 'Y'`. Since `product_id` is unique, we simply return the `product_id` of matching records.

# Approach
1. Use a `SELECT` query to retrieve `product_id` from the `Products` table.
2. Apply a `WHERE` condition to filter rows where both `low_fats` and `recyclable` are `'Y'`.
3. Return the results ordered by `product_id` in descending order (`ORDER BY 1 DESC`).

# Complexity
- **Time complexity:**  
  - The query scans the `Products` table, making it **O(n)** in the worst case, where *n* is the number of rows.
  - If an index exists on `low_fats` and `recyclable`, the performance improves.
  
- **Space complexity:**  
  - The query uses **O(1)** additional space as it does not require extra data structures apart from the result set.

# Code
```mssql
/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */
SELECT 
    product_id
FROM Products
WHERE low_fats = 'Y' AND recyclable = 'Y'
ORDER BY 1 DESC;
